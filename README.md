# BSc (Hons) Computer Science L6 Programming Project
## Machine Learning Model Comparisons

This project demonstrates usage of the following technologies:
* __Python (VS Code)__
* __Keras (Tensorflow)__
* __Scikit-Learn__

The task:
1. Use external libraries to develop multilayer perceptron, support vector machine, decision tree, and random forest models
2. Train and test the models after normalising the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset
3. Observe metrics between models
